### 1. In a script, initialize an array (that has length == 3) of your favourite people, represented as `String`s, and `log` it.

### 2. In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the `String`s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a `UInt64` that represents the order in which you use them from most to least. For example, YouTube --> 1, Reddit --> 2, etc. If you've never used one before, map it to 0!

### 3. Explain what the force unwrap operator `!` does, with an example different from the one I showed you (you can just change the type).
The force unwrap operator unwraps an optional to determine if the type is true the type or nil, which creates panic and aborts the optional execution.
Example:

### 4. Using this picture below, explain...
  - What the error message means
    - The error means there is an mismatch between the expected String and the actual non-String that was returned by the script.
  - Why we're getting this error
    - The type and the return value types are different.
  - How to fix it
