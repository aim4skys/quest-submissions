### 1. What does "force casting" with as! do? Why is it useful in our Collection?
"Force cast" with `as!` downcast generic type to a more specific type to ensure deposit are for the intended collection.
### 2. What does auth do? When do we use it?
Much like `as!`, `auth` downcast a generic type to a more specific type in an authorized reference.  It is used to read metadata of a NFT resource.
### 3. This last quest will be your most difficult yet. Take this contract: and add a function called borrowAuthNFT just like we did in the section called "The Problem" above. Then, find a way to make it publically accessible to other people so they can read our NFT's metadata. Then, run a script to display the NFTs metadata for a certain id.
